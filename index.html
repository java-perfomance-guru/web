				<h3>Do you have PERFORMANCE PROBLEMS

				<p>With almost 20 years experience with java applications, chances are good, that we recognize the
				   symptoms and help you right away. But, of course, each application is different and yours can have
				   unique problems.<br>
				   With our analytic approach and the right tools we will hunt your problem, eliminate all white spots
				   in your application and find the refugee.
				   And, as additional benefit, next time you get in troubles you will have all the tools and techniques
				   to resolve it quickly by yourself.

				<h3>Ineffeficent GARBAGE COLLECTION or just a MISSING INDEX?</h3>

				<p>The range of the problems in a high complex structure, which current applications are can be huge.
				   Often finding a problem is like searching for an needle in a universe of haystacks. Our APPLICATION
				   DISCOVERY package
				   gives you the control of your application by making it transparent and predictable.
				   And it doesn't require you having an extreme technical background. You will understand your
				   application better, regardless if you are a MANAGER or a DEVELOPER.

				<h2>Perfomance Problems</h2>

				<p>
					There are a lot of things that can go wrong in a modern e-commerce
					site, a b2c portal, a service marketplace or just a sophisticated application. 
					Unfortunately most people will care about performance and health monitoring when its too late, and they
					actually have performance problems.
					Still we can help you <a href="http://www.moskito.org" target="blank_">by implementing tools</a> that will help you to discover
					your application, eliminate white spots in your performance monitoring one by one until you know
					exactly what happens in your application, and
					where are it's limits.<br/><br/>
					There are a lot of possible performance problems you may encounter: various garbage collection
					issues, slow database queries, lock contention, thread starving to name the few. Often they are
					caused by bugs or misconfigurations. We will help you to find them, eliminate them
					and ensure that they won't go unnoticed next time.
					<br/><br/>
					And, if the problem is within the application itself, we will help you to make it scale both,
					architecture- and deploywise.

				<h2>Application Management</h2>

				<p>
					To build and deploy an application is a good start, but the real trick is to run it 24x7 for long
					long long time. This is where we excel. Because we have the tools (link to moskito control) and more
					than 15 years experience in application management of high traffic applications, we will help you to
					visualize the health state of your application, determine the key thresholds and bottlenecks and
					setup the required monitoring to overview the status of your application not on the disk/cpu level,
					but on business level.
					<br/><br/>
					The classical monitoring approach will tell you if you have enough disk space. We will tell you if
					your site is generating the business value it should, and if the business processes like
					registration, checkout or subscription payment are working as they should.
					<br/><br/>
					Even the best site in the world can go down, but you should know it before your customers do and be
					able to react in time.

				<h2>Architecture </h2>

				<p>
					The scaleability of a system starts with its architecture. It is fairly easy to scale a well designed system, and it is nearly impossible to scale a spaghetti monolith.
					<br/><br/>
					With over 15 Years of experience in building high traffic portals, we know how to scale and what pitfalls to avoid. Our approach roots in the classic component-oriented design and service-oriented-architecture (SOA) with a flair of
					<br/><br/>
					Design by Responsibility. The new word to describe it is MicroServices. But our main Paradigm is KISS - we won't try to solve your future problems, instead we will help you to achieve your goals and become a thin, manageable, extendable and flexible architecture which can serve you years.
